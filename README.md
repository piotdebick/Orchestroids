# Orchestroids

## About
Orchestroids is a '2D platform shooter' that helps the player learn musical tones
in the C scale. The longer you play, the better your ear becomes at identifying
each sound and its' corresponding Key.

## Objective
The objective of the game is to destroy asteroids before they reach earth.
You do this by identifying each individual asteroids note 'sequence' and
shooting that sequence back at them.

## How To Play
Left-mouse-click on an incoming asteroid to hear its' sequence. Match the sequence
with keyboard keys 1-8, which represent notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and C,
respectively. Keyboard keys 1-8 will allow you to play the notes, as well as ready
them as a sequence for loading (alternatively, you can use LMB). Only the first three notes you play will be chosen
as the sequence unless you reload. Once you have chosen a sequence, load it into
your canon, aim with your mouse, and shoot with left-mouse-click!
